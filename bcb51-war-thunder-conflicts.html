Editorial Reviews. In David Weber's Honor Harrington epic, peace serves only as an entrée to brutal aftermaths. In this case, the hard-fought Star Kingdom campaigns against the People's Republic of Haven have quieted, but in its place, an even more ominous threat looms. So this is a game I played years ago, but they seem to have a big update that brings a campaign for new players, so I got reinterested in it and I thought this would be a fun game for Alt-Night. It's not 100% like War Thunder because there is some PvE content and open-space content we can do as group(4 players). Kinda works like Warframe in that regards, except it's more of a PvP focused game. There is also squads (12 players) but it's more advanced content. There is many types of ships There are a lot of nice demos out there for the DK1/DK2 and most of them are fun for 5 minutes. There are also some games that I like a lot. One game, Lunar Flight, is in my opion one of the better ones. .but two games now got all my time with the DK2: Star Conflict I have played this game over 250 hours with the DK1! No motion-sickness for me at all - I can play for hours! Now with the DK2 this game not only play well in VR, it also looks fantastic!

Ignore that anti tank missile. So since SC is going to be skill based, I'm wondering what the best space flight sim would be (other than the SC:DF module of course) to start practicing my dogfighting skills. Wanna get my 10000 hours now so I'm a true pro when it finally hits shelves. 
Hey guys, I just got my DK2 two days ago, I've been trying to play Warthunder with it. The image I get in the game is kind of off, I see sort of a double image, it's pretty hard to read things. I've done some research, and tried tweaking the IPD, making it half of the value, but still, nothing changed. Does anyone have a solution to this? And another thing is, I can't get the in cockpit view. By touching V key, I can only cycle through third person view, and the "HUD". From what information is available, is there a relationship there? Should I get practice. Just got first gaming pc average specs I guess not crisis 3 on high but I can play most games fine. So what are good games that also have nice graphics (like far cry 3) nothing indie. Usage in the battles. The T-34-85's best play style is that of a flanker. Due to its high mobility, fast turret traverse, and a capable cannon with excellent.
